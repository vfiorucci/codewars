"""Description.

Welcome, Warrior! In this kata, you will get a message and 
you will need to get the frequency of each and every character!

Explanation
Your function will be called char_freq/charFreq/CharFreq and 
you will get passed a string, you will then return a dictionary 
(object in JavaScript) with as keys the characters, and as 
values how many times that character is in the string. You can 
assume you will be given valid input.
